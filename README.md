## Overview

The LearningTrack Application is a group project aimed to help young children with their studying for school. The application can generate a large number of unique tests on demand for a variety of subjects for students in grade levels 1 through 5. Users will be able to create accounts to see their averages in each subject as well as compare them to the test grades of other users throughout the application.  Users will be able to test without worry as the tests will be AI-generated to make sure the tests are all unique. The application will recommend practice in subjects where the user is struggling in the most, to help bolster their skillsets in these fields. Through the development of the Automated Study Application, we aim to help improve the learning experience of students in grades 1 through 5.

## How to Use

LearningTrack allows students in grade levels 1 through 5 to practice and test their knowledge across four core school subjects (math, English, history & science). To begin using the application, users must first create an account. If the user does not already have an account, they should navigate to the registration page to create one. After registering, users can log in to access their personalized Landing Screen. The dashboard allows users to navigate to any of the four subjects, quiz themselves, and view the results of the last 10 tests based on the subject.

## Layouts and Formatting

# Splash Screen

The Splash Screen of the LearningTrack application serves as the main hub for access into the platform. Designed with a calming color and child-friendly interface, it features a simple and inviting layout that appeals to young students while maintaining a clean, organized structure. At the top of the screen is a custom taskbar, which includes three main controls: a Close button to safely exit the app, a Minimize button for keeping the app running in the background, and a Login button that directs users to the login page. This login step ensures that students can save their progress and view personalized recommendations. Most importantly, the Start button launches the main application, taking the user into their tailored learning environment based on the selected account.

# Login Screen

(Insert Login Screen image later)

The Login Screen of the LearningTrack application is a standard login interface. It features a clean design along with a custom taskbar. The taskbar includes only a close button, with similar design to the splash screen buttons. The screen contains three input fields: one each for the user's username, email, and password. Beneath the input fields are two buttons: the Login button and a Register link. The Login button functions by checking the entered username, email, and password against the application's user database. If the credentials do not match an existing account, an error message will be displayed and the user will remain on the login screen. If the credentials are correct, the user will be logged in and redirected to the Landing Screen.

# Register Screen

(Insert Register Screen image later)

(Verify information) The Register Screen of the LearningTrack application is a standard registration interface. It contains five required text fields for the user to enter: username, email, password, first name, and last name. The username must meet specific requirements. It must be between 2 and 25 characters in length, contain only word characters and the "-" character, and be unique so that no two users can have the same username. The email must also meet certain conditions. It must be a valid format containing an "@" symbol and a domain (e.g., .com), and it must be unique to ensure that no duplicate accounts exist. The password must be between 2 and 25 characters and use only word characters. Both the first name and last name must also be between 2 and 25 characters, and they may only include letters and apostrophes.

# Subject Select Screen 

(Insert Subject Select Screen here)

(Verify Information) The Subject Select Screen is focused on four key attributes of the user.  First in the top left corner a user can choose one of the optional profile pictures for their account; Furthermore,
to the right of the profile picture is a drop down tab which allows you to select grade leves 1 through 5. In the bottom middle of the screen you will see another drop down tab allowing the user to select between 
10, 15, or 20 questions. On the left side of the screen are four buttons each pertaining to a different subject.  These subjects are either Math, Science, English, or History.  Once a subject is selected, displayed on the right will be a variety of information about your last 10 tests in that subject.  Some examples of the information displayed is your average, scores, and question count.  Lastly when you are ready to take an exam, make sure the subject you want is selected along with your grade level and question count. Finally, click the test button to begin. 

# Test Screen

Towards the bottom of the screen you will see three buttons previous, next, and submit. The Previous button will bring you back to a prior question.
