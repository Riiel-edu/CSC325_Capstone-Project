# CSC325_Capstone-Project

### Overview

The Automated Study Application is a group project aimed to help young children with their studying for school. The application can generate a large number of unique tests on demand for a variety of subjects for students in grade levels 1 through 5. Users will be able to create accounts to see their averages in each subject as well as compare them to the test grades of other users throughout the application.  Users will be able to test without worry as the tests will be AI-generated to make sure the tests are all unique. The application will recommend practice in subjects where the user is struggling in the most, to help bolster their skillsets in these fields. Through the development of the Automated Study Application, we aim to help improve the learning experience of students in grades 1 through 5.
